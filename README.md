<br>

## Installation ðŸ’¾
To install script, open a comand line in a directory where you want to have script installed and use git clone command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/13Dominik/mail-generator.git
```
Setting up a new project and then use:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
It will download all packages which are needed to run script

## Usage ðŸ”§
The main problem with script is a fact that when server have to much request, it blocks by IP adress.It means that you can set up max 2 accounts in a row 
and then you have to wait to be unbanned.

To avoid it you can use a proxy, but there is the same situation, max 2 accounts and then it will be propably banned for some period of time.

Additionally it must be a polish proxy.The best solution would be use a polish rotating proxy.It will propably eliminate a problem.

If you want to use a proxy make a new file named .env and set up proxy like in file .env_example:

<img src ="Images/Proxy.png" >
Now, script will load proxy from file .env and use it.
If you don't want to use proxy, just miss this step.<br><br>
Now you can run main.py<br>
You will see how program fill all the labels and clicking buttons.When everything is fine you will be redirected to new page like this:<br><br>
<img src ="Images/Zalozone_konto_komunikat.png" > <br>
On the terminal you will see this:<br><br>
<img src ="Images/Zalozone_konto_terminal_komunikat.png" > <br>
On your project folder will be created file saved_accounts.txt.Data about all created accounts will be saved to this file.<br><br>
<img src ="Images/Zalozone_konto_saved_accounts.png" > <br>

When after refreshing page you see this:<br><br>
<img src ="Images/Komunikat_ze_strony_po_zblokowaniu.png" ><br><br>
And on terminal you see this:<br><br>
<img src ="Images/Terminal_po_zablokowaniu.png" ><br><br>
It means you have been blocked by IP and now you have to wait some period of time to be unblocked or think about proxy.You can also make a hotspot from your's
smartphone but it is only temporary solution cause after 2 accounts you will be banned again.<br><br>
There is also some problems not connected with blocking by IP.Program can be terminated and you will see this on terminal:<br><br>
<img src ="Images/Problem_z_set_new_account.png" ><br><br>
In this case just rerun program.<br>
It was the most commonly problems. If something different appear, look what was written on terminal cause propably it would be a exception
calling with which function occured a problem.<br><br>
If you have some questions, just write ðŸ˜Š
